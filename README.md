# cyclonedds-sys
Rust binding to cyclone-dds  https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds.git .

Supports only Linux. I'm looking for help to make this work on Windows.

# Generated bindings

This consists of mostly code generated by bindgen and is not meant to be used directly. The cyclonedds-rs crate 
provides a rust api over this the sys crate. 

# System Dependencies
